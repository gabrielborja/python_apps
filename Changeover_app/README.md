# CHANGEOVER APP

## **Problem statement**:
When working in a manufacturing plant, is extremely common to change from one SKU or product to another (CHANGEOVER), based on the current demand and production plan. The changeover activity can be challenging for many of the operators controlling the production line, especially if the number of products grow in size, and several parameters need to be tracked and monitored in order to comply with the expected quality and productivity requirements.

## **Solution**:
The CHANGEOVER APP built with Python helps address this issue. It uses a Product class powered by Pandas to take care of fetching and parsing the necessary data, returning the ID code, product group and time needed for all combination of products of the manufacturing line. The MainApplication class uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI, so that the final users in the production line can select all possible combination of products, and immediately display the necessary data to prepare for the changeover.
