# IDEAS DASHBOARD

## **Problem statement**:
Many companies have an ideas generation system to follow up on different initiatives, from generation to implementation. Sometimes is hard to track how this system is performing, how to categorize the different ideas and present this in a visual manner so that different stakeholders can explore the overall metrics and trends.

## **Solution**:
Build a Dashboard app using Pythonüêç, Dash and Plotly which summarizes the performance of the ideas managament system, allowing the users to interact with various charts and use dropdown menus to visualize the results by different years and departments.
